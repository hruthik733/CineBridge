# 🎬 CineBridge – Your Gateway to Movies Across OTT Platforms

## 🌟 Why CineBridge?

In today’s OTT era, watching a movie should be simple — but it's not.

You think of a movie. You open Netflix. Not there.
You try Prime Video. Nope.
You Google it. Endless links. You still don’t know where to watch it.

💡 Why should *you* have to chase content?
